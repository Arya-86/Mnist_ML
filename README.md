# MNIST Digit Classification Challenge
## Project Overview
This repository contains our work on the MNIST digit classification challenge, which involves classifying handwritten digits represented as 28x28 pixel grayscale images. The MNIST dataset is fundamental in the field of machine learning, comprising 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, labeled from 0 to 9. Our goal is to decode the complex patterns of each digit and showcase a robust understanding of various machine learning techniques.

## Methodology
We approached this challenge by:

* **Developing Neural Networks from Scratch**: Building and training neural networks to understand foundational concepts.
* **Using Advanced Frameworks**: Implementing models in PyTorch to explore and optimize deep learning techniques.
* **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tuning our models to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in digit classification.

## Repository Contents
* **/notebooks**: This directory contains the Google Colab notebook with our complete analysis, model development, and evaluation.
* **MNIST_Classification.ipynb**: A comprehensive notebook detailing our approach from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**: For all programming needs.
* **PyTorch**: For creating and training deep learning models.
* **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

## Getting Started
To run the notebook:

1. Open MNIST_Classification.ipynb in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to see the model in action.
3. Modify and experiment with different model architectures or parameters to explore further improvements.

## Challenges and Learnings
Throughout this project, we deepened our understanding of:

* The complexity of image-based machine learning tasks.
* The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks for image classification.
* Techniques for improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.
